  Building Blocks Starter (/w GatsbyJS)
</h1>

Kick off your project with this starter project powered by Gatsby. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files and custom <u>Building Block</u> React components to get up and running.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the hello-world starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the hello-world starter
    gatsby new building-blocks-starter https://github.com/patrickmelville/building-blocks-starter
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd building-blocks-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    Your graphql info is available at `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`.

1.  **Build a production ready version of the site**

    ```shell
    gatsby clean (optional: deletes the entire public folder)
    gatsby build
    ```

    building-blocks-starter/public will now have a production ready build of the site.
